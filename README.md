# Face-Detection-Accuracy-Analysis-in-Video-Using-OpenCV-Face-Recognition
This project evaluates the accuracy of face detection in a video using OpenCV and Face Recognition libraries. The system processes an uploaded video, detects faces frame by frame, and calculates the percentage of frames where a face is successfully detected
